# WDIKT2
This is Part 2 to my Why Do I Know This test. Cleaner, easier to write, fun! 
The computer now says all the questions, and you don't have to enter your name on the command line.
All new questions, and the option to quit at any time by typing quit.
Also command line based, also made for Mac. Windows versions coming very soon!
